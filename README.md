# opencv-game
A flappy bird style game where you can play with your hands! Without touching the keyboard! Or your mouse! It is kind of hardware demanding at the moment, so be cautious
when you try it out. I will not be taking any responsibility for exploding laptops ;)

## How to play
Launch the game. Make sure your camera is facing you or your hand. Close all 5 fingers together to flap.

## About
OpenCV, MediaPipe and Pygame are required to run this program, you can probably find how to download them on the internet.
Or, if you are already very cool, you probably have these libraries already installed.

This game appears to be very poorly optimized (as indicated by the horrendous frame rate when playing). I am still learning and searching for a solution to that problem.
This is also still a very early prototype. I will be adding more UI and sprites as I keep working.

The random obstacle generator can and should also be improved. Currently I am using a very simple function to do it, and it does not result in ideal obstacle positioning, but hey, it gets the idea down atleast.

Any advice would be appreciated :D

## Things to work on
1. A more efficient system for storing obstacles, possibly a linked list?
2. How to increase frame rate? I think mediapipe is pretty demanding at the moment.
3. Start/End screen

## Fluff
Please be advised, the code is also very poorly formatted and just be mindful of your own sanity as you read through my code :D
